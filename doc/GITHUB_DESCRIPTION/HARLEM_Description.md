##HARLEM (HAmiltonians for Response properties of LargE Molecules)

HARLEM is a multipurpose interactive Molecular Modeling package. 
It is designed to combine modern electronic structure, statistical mechanics 
and Machine Learning techniques controlled by a graphical interface 
to provide an effective theoretical tool to study complex properties 
and function of macromolecular systems such as biocatalysis, 
long-rang electron transfer, ion membrane permeation, ligand binding 
and protein-protein interactions.   
 
HARLEM provides an interface to popular molecular modeling packages 
such as GAUSSIAN and AMBER, GROMACS, HARLEM is an open developing platform. 
HARLEM is currently being developed and maintained 
by Igor Kurnikov (http://harlemprog.org) and members of Maria Kurnikova’s lab 
at Carnegie Mellon University (http://crete.chem.cmu.edu).
