current wxPython 4.1.1 with wxWidgets 3.1.5 ??

had to modify sizer.cpp  commenting several asserts for sizers 
also commented

wxPython-4.1.1/ext/wxWidgets/include/wx/strvararg.h(484):

assert "(argtype & (wxFormatStringSpecifier<T>::value)) == argtype"  

that gave an error:

failed in wxArgNormalizer(): format specifier doesn't match argument type

commented these asserts ( in addition two more asserts in sizer.cpp ) in: 

wxPython-4.1.1_FIX_SIZER_EXT.tar.gz
