files:
gly_dimer.hlm      - HARLEM file of the glycine dimer
scan_ene_gly_1.py  - HARLEM/python script to scan energy vs torsion angle (Gly1.N - Gly1.CA - Gly1.C - Gly2.N)
mc_rot_gly_1.py    - HARLEM/python script to perform MC simulation for rotation around torsion angle (Gly1.N - Gly1.CA - Gly1.C - Gly2.N)
build_hist.py      - HARLEM/python script to build a distribution histogram of the torsion angle values 

1. Load  gly_dimer.hlm to HARLEM 

2. Open Molecular Mechanics Module and Initialize MM model for the glycine dimer:
        
	Main menu: Basic Models->Molecular Mechanics
        Choose "Edit MM Model" tab and press "Init MM Model" button

3. Identify the torsion angle (Gly1.N - Gly1.CA - Gly1.C - Gly2.N)  and compute 
    molecular mechanics energy at certain values of the torsion angle.
	
    We will further refer to this torsion angle as PHI = Gly1.N - Gly1.CA - Gly1.C - Gly2.N
 
    Show atom IDs in Molecular View:  
		Main menu: Display->Labels->Atom IDs
 
    Compute the value of this torsional angle  using "Edit Geometry"  Dialog
        Main Menu:  Edit->Edit Geometry
        Pick Gly1.N,Gly1.CA,Gly1.C,Gly2.N  atoms sequentially by clicking mouse left button on the molecular view 
        Press the "Calc Geom Params" button  to display the torsion angle value 
	
        Compute MM energy by pressing "Calculate Single Point Energy" 
        in the "Molecular Mechanics Module" dialog ("MM Run Parameters" tab)
        See MM energy in Console window
        Manually change the torsion angle PHI to 0.0 degrees
        using the "Edit Molecular geometry" Dialog (set new torsonal angle value and press
                                                "Set Geom Params")
        Recompute MM energy.
        Analyze what components of MM energy changed as a result of the geometry transformation

4. Scan MM energy as a function of the PHI torsion angle values:
        Load Script scan_ene_gly_1.py using File->Load Script Dialog 
        Execute Script ("Execute Script" button )
        See Dependence of energy vs torsional angle in "ene.out" file
        Load profile of energy vs torsional angle into excel
        Compute probability of torsional angle for different temperatures (300K, 1000K, 10000K) 
        using Boltzmann distribution

5. Run a Monte Carlo simulation for rotation of the gly monomers with respect to each other  
   (via modifying the PHI torsion angle) 
    using script mc_rot_gly_1.py
   
6. Analyze distribution of the torsional angle values along the MC trajectory using the script build_hist.py 
   The output file of the script is hist.out file that lists how often the torsion angle falls into 
   a particular interval of values.
   
   Repeat 5. and 6. Changing the number of MC steps to 10000 and 100000 
                    and for T = 300K, 1000K, 10000K ( you will need to change nstep and kt parameters
                    in mc_rot_gly_1.py script, note kt is in kcal/mol in the script)

7. Compare distributions of torsion anlges obtained in MC simulations at different temperatures
   with the Bolzmann distribution obtained in 4. 
  Take into account that in 4. and 6. sizes of the torsion angle intervals were different.
