      for cytochrome-b5 protein: 
      Restart HARLEM, Load CB5.pdb file and repeat steps 1-5 for this molecule
      Save fixed protein molecule to cb5_1.hlm file in HLM format

 7. Compute electrostatic field in and around the protein using continuum electrostatics
    calculations: 
  
    1) Load saved myo_1.hlm file (or continue if myoglobin structure is already loaded).

                                     press Delete
   
    4) Plot isopotential surfaces at different isolevel value:
             In Continuum Electrostatics Dialog: Set "Isolevel Value" to 0.5 (kT) 
             Press "Plot isopotential Surface"

    5) Delete isopotential surfaces using "3D objects" Dialog.
           Press "Update Object List" to get an updated list of objects
           select and delete objects named "isopot_surf....."
  
    6) Color protein surface by electrostatic potential. 
           In Continuum Electrostatics Dialog:  press "Color molecule Surface by El.Pot" 

  9. Compute Electrostatic field at different pH values and standard residue pKa:
      
       1) Open Protonation and redox Equilibrium dialog:
          Main Menu:  Applications->Protonation and Redox Equilibrium
       2) Set residue standard pKa: Protonation->Set Std pKa
          
       
       3) Set Charges for set residue pKa and given pH:
              Open "Edit Atom Parameters" Dialog
              Set pH value to 5.0
              Compute Charges for set pH:  Charges->"Set Charges for current pH" 
       4) Compute total charge of the molecule: Charges->Calc Charge and Dipole
